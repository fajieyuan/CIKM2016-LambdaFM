# LambdaFM
LambdaFM: Learning Optimal Ranking with Factorization Machines Using Lambda Surrogates.

LambdaFM has been used in many recommender systems, e.g., Tencent Inc: https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/article/1063837 
Note that LambdaFM code can be added in fBGD framework (https://github.com/fajieyuan/fBGD)  following the way of PRFM (Java file: RankFM_nextmusic). 

If you find the code is very slow, you can refactor it on your own platform since the sampling in librec1.3 is very show.
